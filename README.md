Resolve the old problem with chargers

I love using old Macbook Pro 15" 2015 because it has all the ports and costs relatively cheap ()

## Problem
Because of continuous bending stock cable breaks after 2.5 years of usage. It usually looks like that:

Also because Apple uses custom voltage and amperage 20V-4.25A - many USB Power Delivery devices wont suit perfectly. 

For example I tested Baseus GaN 100W "4 ports" chager and Baseus GaN 100W "Quick charge 5" charger and Apple 96W original charger. Overall experience better with Apple 96W charger.


## Solution

Get an [Apple 96W charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter) (or you can get used charger from Ebay)
Get an [Ugreen Magsafe 2<=>Type-C neylon cable](aliexpress.com/item/1005003894222611.html) from Aliexpress

Problem solved
