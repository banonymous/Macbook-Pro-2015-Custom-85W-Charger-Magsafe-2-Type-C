# Macbook-Pro-2015-Custom-85W-Charger-Magsafe-2-Type-C
Resolve "the chargers problem" with good ol' Macbook Pro. 

A year ago I bought a used Macbook Pro 15" 2015 because it has great hardware, all the needed ports, needed software support and it costs relatively cheap ($1100 for a good one). 
But there is only one MAJOR issue with it...


## Problem
Because of continuous bending stock charger cable breaks after ~2.5 years of usage. After that period of time charger usually looks like that:

### Context

Apple uses custom voltage and amperage 20V / 4.25A. 
And Power Delivery chargers have slighly higher amperage (20V / 5A) - thats why as far as I understood modern GaN chargers could not work well with that configuration.

#### Chargers
I tested these chargers:
- Baseus 100W GaN 2 type-c ports 
- Baseus 100W GaN with 1 type-c port (owned 2 of them, both died)
- Baseus 100W auto-charger with 1 type-c and 1 type-A ports
- Original Apple 96W with 1 type-c port

**TLDR:** among all - only Apple's charger and auto-charger worked normally. Other worked with flaws and stopped working with time.

#### Cables
I tested these cables and adapters:
- noname adapter
- Baseus 60W cable
- Ugreen 85W cable

**TLDR:** Ugreen cable is the best in terms of user experience. Noname adapter charges well, but not convenients to you coz easy to lose. 


## Solution
//TODO: pic!

So to get rid of the problem once and for all you need:

1. Get an [Apple 96W charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter) (or you can get used charger from Ebay)

2. Get an [Ugreen Magsafe 2<=>Type-C neylon cable](aliexpress.com/item/1005003894222611.html) from Aliexpress

Problem solved
